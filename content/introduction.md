# Introduction
Take a moment and think of a landmark which represents the ongoing presence of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), Stó:lō and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil- Waututh) Nations. 

One example is the welcome figure right underneath Burrard Bridge, on the seawall. You can only get there by foot or by bike. It is often a bit overgrown, and in some sort representative because it is there but unnoticed. The Squamish First Nation will be leading a new housing development (Senakw) in the next years. 

This leads us to the first non-tech example: if we were to encode landmarks in Vancouver which are affiliated with the First Nations history and present, we could -tag- this place. 

Input
{: .label .label-green }
```sh
$ I will be biking past <placeName> the Welcome Figure underneath Burrard Bridge </placeName> on the Sea Wall today.

```
In a simplified way, we have the possiblity to extract the tagged knowledge with the corresponding html shell, and can find all place names we would have marked up throughout a bigger text. 

Output
{: .label .label-yellow }
```sh
Place Names:
the Welcome Figure underneath Burrard Bridge
```
